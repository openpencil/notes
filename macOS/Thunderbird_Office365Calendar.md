# Make Office 365 Calendar work with Thunderbird

## In 5 Steps:


1.  Make sure the _Lightning add-on_ is installed on Thunderbird. You can look for add-ons under the "Tools" menu item. If the _Lightning add-on_ is not installed, [follow instructions from here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-lightning-thunderbird) for installing the add-on.


2.  Download the [exchangecalendar add-on file, `exchangecalendar-v4.0.0-beta2.xpi`, linked on this page](https://github.com/ExchangeCalendar/exchangecalendar/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta2).

3.  Drop the downloaded file, `exchangecalendar-v4.0.0-beta2.xpi` into the add-on manager pane and install the add-on.

4.  Click on [https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx](https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx), and login with your full email and current password. This will "create the service" needed for your Outlook365 calendar to function.

5.  Follow [instructions on this page](https://github.com/Ericsson/exchangecalendar/wiki/How-to-Add-Your-Calendar-to-Thunderbird) to set up your Outlook365 calendar account with Thunderbird.
